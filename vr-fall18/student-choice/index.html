    <h4>Student Choice: Sephora Visual Artist</h4>
    <br>
    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>Already halfway through the semester, we have observed a number of different technologies 
    for both virtual and augmented reality.Developing with Vuforia especially, I was able to explore 
    the different ways augmented reality can further be pushed to expand the way we approach interaction.
    Project 1 was meant to use everyday breakfast to advertise a product to the user. 
    This futuristic form of marketing is what encouraged me to choose Sephora’s augmented reality app as 
    the topic of my Student’s Choice presentation. The app is called Sephora Virtual Artist and alllows the user to
    to test out a variety of makeup products by using the front facing webcam.
